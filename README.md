# NetLurker

Net monitoring application for [NetLogger](https://www.netlogger.org)

This application is built using C++ Builder, which is free to use for non-commercial purposes. I chose this as I am a longtime user of C++ Builder and I appreciate the simplicity of the C++ Builder/Delphi runtime library ecosystem for building native desktop apps. I've been around since the [Turbo C 1.5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Turbo_C) days.

This is a straightforward project built using the IDE so there is no complicated build environment to deal with. It uses the FireMonkey UI library, so there is potential for crossplatform useage for Mac iOS, and Android in the future, if desired.
